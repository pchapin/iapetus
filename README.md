Iapetus
=======

Iapetus is a web application that allows amateur astronomers to prepare observing sessions,
record their observations, and build a community. It is intended to offer features supporting
both individual observers and groups of observers. It is intended to provide reference material,
personal logs, picture galleries, wikis, blogs, and more. In its most mature form Iapetus would
be a comprehensive, "one-stop" site for all things related to making, recording, and sharing
amateur astronomical observations.

Currently, the project is little more than a placeholder, but... well... you have to start
somewhere!

Setup
-----

The front-end of Iapetus is written in JavaScript using [|insert appropriate front-end
technology here|]. The back-end is in PHP to conform to what I have available to me on my
web-hosting service.

There is also an experimental back-end in Ada using the Ada Web Server (AWS). Everything related
to that back-end is in the `Ada` folder. It is extremely minimal at the moment.
