Iapetus
=======

Iapetus is a web application that allows amateur astronomers to prepare observing sessions,
record their observations, and build a community. It is intended to offer features supporting
both individual observers and groups of observers. It is intended to provide reference material,
personal logs, picture galleries, wikis, blogs, and more. In its most mature form Iapetus would
be a comprehensive, "one-stop" site for all things related to making, recording, and sharing
amateur astronomical observations.

Currently, the project is little more than a placeholder, but... well... you have to start
somewhere!

Setup
-----

The primary implementation of Iapetus is in Scala using Scala.js with Laminar for the frontend
and Scala with (???) for the backend.

There are also two alternate implementations, neither of which is very mature. There is a
skeletal React version in JavaScript with a PHP backend, and an even more skeletal Ada version
using AWS for the backend with an unknown frontend technology. Neither of these alternate
versions are under active development and they may be removed at some future time.
